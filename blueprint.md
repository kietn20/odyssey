Project Brief: "Odyssey" - A Real-Time Drone Fleet Management Platform
1. Project Vision & Concept
Odyssey is a distributed, real-time platform for the command, control, and monitoring of a fleet of simulated autonomous drones. It will function as the "mission control" software for a theoretical logistics or surveying operation, capable of ingesting high-frequency telemetry, issuing commands, and visualizing the entire fleet's operational status on a live dashboard.
The core of this project is to build a complex, multi-service system using modern, industry-standard, cloud-native technologies, demonstrating an ability to architect and deploy software at a professional level.
2. High-Level Goals & Career Impact
The primary goal of "Odyssey" is to serve as a capstone portfolio project that showcases mastery of skills highly sought after by top-tier tech companies, particularly those in the aerospace, robotics, developer tooling, and enterprise SaaS sectors (e.g., SpaceX, Palantir, Nuro, Ramp, Veeva).
Upon completion, this project will provide definitive proof of expertise in:
Distributed Systems & Microservices Architecture
Real-Time Data Processing & Low-Latency Communication
Containerization & Orchestration with Docker and Kubernetes
End-to-End Cloud Deployment & CI/CD Automation
3. System Architecture & Blueprint
The platform will be built on a microservices architecture, with each component designed to be independent and scalable.
1. Drone Simulators (
Multiple lightweight scripts, each representing a single drone.
Responsibilities: Maintain its own state (ID, position, battery, status), generate periodic telemetry data, and listen for commands from the C2 service.
Communication: Pushes telemetry to the Telemetry Service via gRPC (for high performance) or MQTT (for IoT standard).
2. Telemetry Service (
Responsibilities: Acts as the high-throughput ingestion point for all drone telemetry. Validates and forwards data to other services.
Communication: Receives telemetry from drones via gRPC/MQTT. Publishes telemetry to a message queue (RabbitMQ or NATS) for other services to consume, and forwards live data to the Web Dashboard via WebSockets.
3. Command & Control (C2) Service (
Responsibilities: Provides a RESTful API for the frontend to issue commands. Manages mission logic (e.g., dispatching a drone to a set of waypoints).
Communication: Exposes a REST API to the dashboard. Sends commands to the relevant drone simulator (e.g., via a message queue or direct gRPC call).
4. Persistence & Analytics Service (
Responsibilities: Subscribes to the telemetry message queue and logs all incoming data to a time-series or relational database for historical analysis. Can also perform simple anomaly detection (e.g., flagging low-battery drones).
Database: PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension for geospatial queries and TimescaleDB for time-series data.
5. Web Dashboard (
Responsibilities: The user-facing mission control interface. Visualizes all drones on a live map, displays real-time telemetry in a table, allows users to issue commands, and view historical flight paths.
Communication: Receives live updates from the Telemetry Service via WebSockets. Sends commands to the C2 Service via its REST API.
4. Technology Stack Summary
Languages: Go, Python, TypeScript
Frameworks: React
Communication: gRPC, REST APIs, WebSockets, MQTT (optional)
Message Queue: RabbitMQ or NATS
Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS & TimescaleDB
Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes (EKS/GKE), Nginx (as ingress controller)
CI/CD: GitHub Actions
5. Phased Development Roadmap
Phase 1: The Core Data Flow (MVP)
Build the Drone Simulator, Telemetry Service, and Web Dashboard.
Goal: Successfully stream telemetry from a single simulated drone to the Go backend and visualize its position moving in real-time on the React dashboard. This validates the entire real-time data pipeline.


Phase 2: Command & Control and Persistence
Build the C2 Service and the Persistence Service.
Goal: Implement the ability to send a command from the dashboard (e.g., "fly to these coordinates") that the drone simulator receives and executes. Simultaneously, ensure all telemetry is being logged to the PostgreSQL database.


Phase 3: Production-Grade Deployment & Scalability
Containerize every microservice using Docker.
Write Kubernetes manifest files (.yaml) to define the deployment, services, and networking for the entire application.
Deploy the entire platform to a managed Kubernetes cluster (Amazon EKS or Google GKE).
Implement a complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions that automates the building of Docker images and their deployment to the Kubernetes cluster on every git push.
6. Success Metrics & Portfolio Presentation
Performance: Achieve a sub-200ms end-to-end latency from a drone simulator sending a telemetry update to that update being reflected on the web dashboard.
Reliability: The system should be able to handle dozens of concurrent drone simulators without performance degradation.
Portfolio Deliverable: A GitHub repository with a detailed README.md containing:
A clear project description and vision.
A high-level System Architecture Diagram.
A GIF or short video demo of the live dashboard in action.
Clear instructions on how to build and deploy the project locally with Docker Compose and to a cloud Kubernetes cluster.
A section on performance metrics and technical challenges overcome.
